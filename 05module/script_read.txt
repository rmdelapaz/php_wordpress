Perfect! I've created a comprehensive set of Python scripts to fix the issues in your PHP WordPress course files:
üìÅ Scripts Created:
1. fix_session_names.py

Adds descriptive session names to sidebar titles (e.g., "Session 3" ‚Üí "Session 3: CSS Basics")
Covers modules 1-6 with appropriate session names for each

2. fix_quick_links.py

Standardizes the Quick Links section across all modules
Ensures consistent navigation with module overview, course home, next module, and resources links

3. fix_mermaid_diagrams.py

Converts problematic Mermaid diagrams to inline SVG
Adds proper styling for Mermaid containers
Specifically handles the bootstrap_grid.html issue

4. validate_structure.py

Comprehensive validation script that checks:

Meta tags presence
Session titles format
Quick Links structure
Navigation buttons
Breadcrumbs
CSS/JS includes
Mermaid diagram issues



5. run_all_fixes.py

Master orchestrator script
Optional backup creation before making changes
Runs all scripts in sequence
Provides comprehensive summary

6. README.md

Complete documentation for all scripts
Usage instructions
Customization guide

üöÄ How to Use:

Test with validation first:
bashpython validate_structure.py

Run all fixes with backup:
bashpython run_all_fixes.py
# Choose 'y' when prompted to create backup

Or run individual fixes:
bashpython fix_session_names.py
python fix_quick_links.py
python fix_mermaid_diagrams.py


üîß Customization Options:
Before running, you might want to:

Review session names in fix_session_names.py - I've added logical names based on the course structure, but you can modify them
Enhance Quick Links logic in fix_quick_links.py - Currently uses a simplified approach, could be enhanced to:

Detect actual file ordering
Add previous/next lesson links based on file sequence
Include session navigation


Add more Mermaid conversions in fix_mermaid_diagrams.py - I've included the bootstrap_grid conversion, you can add more specific conversions for other files

üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features:

Backup creation before any changes
Skip logic for already-correct files
Non-destructive validation to preview issues
Detailed logging of all changes
Error resilience - continues even if individual files fail

The scripts are designed to be safe and idempotent - running them multiple times won't cause issues. They use Windows WSL paths and handle UTF-8 encoding properly.
